**An Integrated Optogenetic and Bioelectronic Platform for Regulating Cardiomyocyte Function.**  
*Advanced Science*, 2024.

We present an integrated optogenetic and bioelectronic system enabling stable, long-term stimulation and monitoring of cardiomyocyte function in vitro. This platform combines precise optical control with embedded bioelectronics to support adaptive and patient-specific cardiac modulation strategies.
