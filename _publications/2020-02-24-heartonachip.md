**Heart-on-a-chip Model with Integrated Extra- and Intra-cellular Bioelectronics for Monitoring Cardiac Electrophysiology under Acute Hypoxia.**  
*Nano Letters*, 2020.

We demonstrated a bioelectronic heart-on-a-chip model for studying the effects of acute hypoxia on cardiac function. A microfluidic channel enabled rapid modulation of medium oxygenation, which mimicked the regimes induced by a temporary coronary occlusion and reversibly activated hypoxia-related transduction pathways in HL-1 cardiac model cells. Extracellular bioelectronics provided continuous readouts demonstrating that hypoxic cells experienced an initial period of tachycardia followed by a reduction in beat rate and eventually arrhythmia. Intracellular bioelectronics consisting of Pt nanopillars temporarily entered the cytosol following electroporation, yielding action potential (AP)-like readouts. We found that APs narrowed during hypoxia, consistent with proposed mechanisms by which oxygen deficits activate ATP-dependent K+ channels that promote membrane repolarization. Significantly, both extra- and intracellular devices could be multiplexed, enabling mapping capabilities unachievable by other electrophysiological tools. Our platform represents a significant advance toward understanding electrophysiological responses to hypoxia and could be applicable to disease modeling and drug development.
