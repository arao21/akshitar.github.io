We demonstrated a bioelectronic heart-on-a-chip model for studying the effects of acute hypoxia on cardiac function. A microfluidic channel enabled rapid modulation of medium oxygenation, which mimicked the regimes induced by a temporary coronary occlusion and reversibly activated hypoxia-related transduction pathways in HL-1 cardiac model cells.
