This study extends our previous work by incorporating modern landmark detection techniques and a more clinically appropriate predictive model for facial nerve assessment. By bridging the gap between computational models and real-world clinical applications, this framework enhances the precision of facial palsy monitoring, offering a more robust tool for surgical decision-making and longitudinal patient assessment.
