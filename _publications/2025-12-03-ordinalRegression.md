**Dynamic Facial Analysis for Predicting Facial Palsy Outcomes: Comparing Landmark Detection Models and Integrating Ordinal Regression.**  
*IEEE EMBS Conference (EMBC)*, 2025.

This work extends prior facial palsy modeling approaches by integrating modern landmark detection methods with ordinal regression for clinically meaningful outcome prediction. The framework improves longitudinal facial nerve assessment and supports surgical decision-making in real-world clinical settings.
