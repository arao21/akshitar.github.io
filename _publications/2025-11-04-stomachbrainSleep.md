**Simultaneous stomach–brain electrophysiology reveals dynamic coupling in human sleep.**  
*bioRxiv*, 2025.

Sleep involves continuous communication between the brain and body, yet the dynamics of peripheral physiology during sleep remain poorly understood. We show that gastric electrophysiology exhibits infraslow structure and coordinated fluctuations with cortical rhythms, revealing a previously uncharacterized mode of brain–body coupling during human sleep.
